                    <p>Sara Weinstein&#8217;s graduate education gave her subject knowledge&#8218; discipline&#8218; and a love of learning. But when switching careers from neuroscience to data science&#8218; she found she lacked some other key resources: guidance&#8218; accountability&#8218; and time. With Springboard&#8217;s curated online curriculum and personal attention from her Springboard mentor&#8218; she gained the skills and confidence she needed to land her dream job as a data scientist. &nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>I tried learning on my own&#8218; and it was overwhelming.</h2>
                        <p>When I started considering Data Science as the next step in my career&#8218; I knew there was a lot I needed to learn. I have a PhD in Neuroscience&#8218; but as I looked at the descriptions for the jobs I wanted&#8218; I realized pretty quickly that I don&#8217;t have all the technical skills I needed.</p>
                        <p>I spent over a year trying to learn them on my own. My strategy was to study statistics and machine learning through online courses. But with all the options out there&#8218; it seemed overwhelming. There was no way I could complete 8 online courses just to get my foot in the door – I had a full-time job as a research officer for the government&#8218; plus two kids to manage too.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I kept stalling&#8218; until I found Springboard. I loved that they had curated the best content for me&#8218; so I didn&#8217;t have to wade through everything myself. I&#8217;m also someone who does better with a bit of external pressure&#8218; and I knew that having a mentor would help me move a lot faster than I&#8217;d been able to alone.</p>

                        <h2>From our very first meeting&#8218; I knew my mentor was special.</h2>
                        <p>My first meeting with my mentor&#8218; Ike&#8218; set the tone for a very productive relationship. We spent a lot of time talking about what I was interested in and what I wanted to get out of Springboard. He kept asking me questions about particular parts of Data Science that I wanted to learn more about. I thought it was nice of him to be so interested&#8218; but I thought he was just being polite.</p>
                        <p>Several hours later&#8218; I got an email from him with a long list of resources tailored specifically to what I&#8217;d told him I wanted to learn. I was absolutely flabbergasted – it must have taken him at least an hour. Here was this total stranger who had taken the time to identify a whole bunch of books&#8218; PDFs and papers just for me&#8218; that I would not have found on my own. It was just amazing!</p>
                        <h2>Hearing real Data Scientists talk was invaluable.</h2>
                        <p>Data Science is a pretty broad field&#8218; with lots of names and terms to learn. When I started&#8218; I felt like I knew what my strengths were and my skill set&#8218; but I didn&#8217;t know the right words to use. I constantly worried about betraying the fact that I was an outsider by saying the wrong thing.</p>
                        <p>In Springboard&#8217;s mentor calls and office hours&#8218; I got to hear how actual Data Scientists talk and the kind of vocabulary they used. I learned what they meant when they talked about things like &#8220;data pipelines&#8221; and &#8220;data warehousing.&#8221; So when I got stuck&#8218; I had a much better idea of what to search for on Google or how to frame questions in the right way. Most importantly&#8218; I felt a lot less insecure when I started looking for jobs&#8218; since I had a stronger grasp over what I was talking about.</p>
                        <h2>I&#8217;m so happy to go to work every day!</h2>
                        <p>For weeks&#8218; I&#8217;d seen a posting for a job with Boeing that I knew I wanted&#8218; but I wasn&#8217;t sure I was ready. My mentor encouraged me to go after it. We did mock interviews&#8218; and he sent me lists of the things I needed to prepare for technical interviews. He held my hand the whole way through the process – which is a big reason I got the job!&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>At work&#8218; I build models to help airplane crews and analysts pull out information from maintenance logs and schedules. I use supervised and unsupervised learning methods to do things like anomaly detection&#8218; so we make sure we see important issues that come up. In other projects&#8218; I&#8217;ve worked with time series data and implemented over 15 different types of algorithms&#8218; like mean shift detection&#8218; to identify outliers.</p>
                        <p>I&#8217;m so happy to go to work every day. It's so much fun&#8218; and it's exactly what I imagined my dream job. My experience shows that it might be tough to get there&#8218; but with the right help&#8218; you definitely can!&nbsp;</p>
